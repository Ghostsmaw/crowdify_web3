# crowdify_web3
A Responsive Web3 Crowdfunding Platform (Kickstarter clone) built on ReactJs, TailwindCss, Solidity, thirdweb and Metamask. An amazing design, connected to the blockchain, metamask pairing, interaction with smart contracts, sending Ethereum through the blockchain network, writing solidity code, and, most importantly, the ability to create, view, and donate to crowdfunding campaigns directly through the blockchain.
